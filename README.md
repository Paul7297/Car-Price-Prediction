using R language 
# 🚗 Car Price Prediction and Clustering (R Project)

### 📘 Description
This project, originally developed on Kaggle, predicts car prices using machine learning models in R and groups similar cars using K-Means clustering.

### 📊 Dataset
[Kaggle: Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction)

### ⚙️ Tools and Libraries
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2, randomForest, cluster, factoextra)
- Kaggle Notebook environment

### 🧠 Key Findings
- Engine size and curb weight are the most influential features for predicting price.  
- Two main car clusters were identified: Economy and Premium segments.  

### 📈 Visualizations
- Feature Importance (Random Forest)  
- Elbow & Silhouette plots (optimal clusters)  
- PCA Cluster visualization  
- Density and Box plots for top car companies  

### 🧩 Clustering Summary
Elbow and Silhouette methods suggested **k = 2** as optimal, clearly separating low-cost and premium cars.
